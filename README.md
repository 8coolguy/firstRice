## About   
Yeaaaaa. I'm pretty new to linux in general,so I had to look up how to do every little thing. Most of the config files were pretty much the auto-generated ones with a few changed.The status is the example one given with different colors lol. Fun project with a lots of improvements I could make. I can't wait to do this with a different system and os. Definetly worth the time because now I have a super fast and effecient work space. I also made a script (nightsettings.py) that changes the vibe during the night hours as shown in the last picture.
